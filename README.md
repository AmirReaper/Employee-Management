# Employee Management System

A simple **Java console-based application** for managing employees in a company.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and static fields, along with user input validation.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new employees with name, base salary, and hourly rate
- View a list of all employees
- Calculate wages (with or without extra hours)
- Find the highest-paid employee
- Show company statistics (employee count, total employees created)
- Input validation to avoid invalid entries

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java SE 17+** (standard edition)
- **ArrayList** for dynamic employee storage
- **Scanner** for user input
- **OOP principles** (Encapsulation, Static Fields, Method Overloading)
