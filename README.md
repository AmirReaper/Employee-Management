# 👥 Employee Management System v2.3.0 – Collections Framework

This release implements the complete **Java Collections Framework** with practical, real-world examples.

## ✨ New Features
- All features from v2.2.0 (Generics)
- **Comprehensive Collections Framework**:
    - **List Operations**: ArrayList usage with iteration and bulk operations
    - **Set Operations**: HashSet for duplicate removal and unique elements
    - **Queue Operations**: LinkedList for FIFO employee processing
    - **Map Operations**: HashMap for fast lookup and employee grouping
    - **Stream API**: Functional programming with filtering, mapping, and reduction
- **Bulk Operations**: Add multiple employees at once
- **Employee Analytics**: Advanced statistics and distribution analysis
- **Advanced Search**: Complex criteria-based employee filtering

## 🏗️ Collections Framework Implementation
- **List**: `ArrayList<Employee>` for ordered employee storage
- **Set**: `HashSet<Employee>` for duplicate detection (based on equals/hashCode)
- **Queue**: `LinkedList<Employee>` for FIFO processing simulation
- **Map**: `HashMap<Integer, Employee>` for hashCode-based lookup
- **Streams**: Functional operations for filtering, sorting, and statistics

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Master **Java Collections Framework** in practical scenarios
- Understand differences between **List, Set, Queue, and Map**
- Practice **Stream API** for functional programming
- Implement **bulk operations** and **data analytics**
- Learn **performance characteristics** of different collections
- Explore **real-world use cases** for each collection type

---

# 💡 Key Collections Concepts

- List: Ordered collection with duplicates - maintains insertion order
- Set: Unique elements only - based on equals() and hashCode()
- Queue: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) processing order
- Map: Key-value pairs for efficient lookup operations
- Streams: Functional programming paradigm for data processing]
- Bulk Operations: Processing multiple elements efficiently

---

# 🎯 Real-World Applications

- Employee Management: Practical use of collections in business applications
- Data Analytics: Statistical analysis and reporting
- Performance Optimization: Choosing the right collection for each use case
- Enterprise Applications: Scalable data structures for large systems

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Java 17 or higher  
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) or simply `javac` / `java` from the terminal
